# USA_Sites

This repo shows all the phylogeny trees (All_Sites_All_Trees.pdf) generated by Open tree and Opentree-Pytoy, using specieslist provided by each site.
However, there still some species can not map back to the open tree with branch length based on current ability of pytoy.


+ The cases (pytoy failed) are recorded in file "pytoy_issues0607.pdf", even though those species do have ottids


+ A summary table shows the statistical status of how species each site can be mapped to Opentree "Summary_USA_Sites.xls" 


+ A script used to integrated pytoy and R script to conduct the analyses "SpList_TrGenerator_v5.sh"


+ There are six folders are named by each site respectively; inside each folder, there are two sub-folders:
	+ One is "species_list" containing the Original species list, update species list (after manula checking names), and No-match species (can not find in Opentree at all)
	+ One is "tree" folder containng all the synthetic tree from Opentree and trees with branth lenght (BR) from "ALLOTB_ott.tre" of Smith and Brown (2018)
